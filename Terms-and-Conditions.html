                We will only accept a Payment Order which is given to us through Our Website. Your instruction to perform a Payment Transaction will be treated by us as your consent to us to go ahead with and our authorisation to perform that Payment Transaction.

                Before we execute any Payment Order, you must ensure that we have received the amount of funds which we tell you are required for the Payment Transaction to proceed in cleared funds immediately available to us by payment made by either debit or credit card. Please note we do not provide credit and are not able to advance any amount to cover any amount of a Payment Transaction.

                If we receive a Payment Order by 3.00pm (GMT) on a Business Day, the Payment Order will be deemed to have been received by us on that Business Day. If a Payment Order is received by us after 3.00pm (GMT) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the Payment Order will be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day.

                Once a Payment Order is received by us it shall be irrevocable except to the extent that it may be withdrawn by you as provided for in the Regulations and as set out in clause 17.

              </ul>
              <p>
                Where a Payment Order is governed by the Regulations we shall proceed with the execution of the Payment Order within a maximum execution time of the end of the second Business Day after the date we have received your Payment Order or the date on which you have made the required cleared funds immediately available to us (whichever is the later date).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the Payment Transaction has been confirmed you will automatically receive an e-mail notification at the address provided by you to us confirming submission of the Payment Transaction. Once the Payment Transaction has been executed by us you will also receive e-mail notifications at the address provided by you to us confirming (i) when the funds have arrived at the Paying Agent and (ii) when the funds have been collected by the Recipient. If a Payment Transaction is not paid to a Recipient within 21 or 30 days (depending on the relevant Paying Agent involved in the Payment Transaction), we will automatically cancel the Payment Transaction and notify you accordingly. Thereafter, the funds comprising the Payment Transaction will not be available for collection by the Recipient and will be held by us on trust until reimbursement (which shall be via the same payment method you used to fund the Payment Transaction).
